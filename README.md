# RicoDerous
## About
Yoh, my name is Federico De Rosa, I attend the Faculty of Computer Science at university (more or less).
I graduated from an IT-oriented high school, where I learnt the basics of procedural programming, OOP, Operating Systems, Networks, Distributed Systems and Databases.
Also web development. _(Brr)_

As I matured, I realised that the average IT worker, where even the least competent was able to get ahead, was not for me.
But I loved solving problems and developed a passion for mathematics, so I eventually decided to continue on a university path, hoping one day to work in some context that would satisfy my brain and avoid falling asleep at work.

## Some Maths I studied (I'm not good, I'm not comparable to a real mathematician, of course).
- Discrete Mathematics
- Logic
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
## Projects
At the moment I have not done anything relatively useful/serious, plus I suffer from great, really great, laziness. 
I am not joking, I think I have some problems.
