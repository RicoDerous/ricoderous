## Some Maths I studied (I'm not good, I'm not comparable to a real mathematician, of course).
- Discrete Mathematics
- Logic
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
## Projects
At the moment, I haven't done anything relatively useful or serious, and I suffer from a great, really great, laziness. I'm not joking, I think I have some problems.
